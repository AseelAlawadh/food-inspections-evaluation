            There are over 15,000 foot establishments across the City of Chicago that are subject to sanitation inspections by the Department of Public Health. Three dozen inspectors responsible for checkin these establishments, so one inspector is responsible for nearly 470 food establishments. Yet, the Department of Public Health has systematically collected the results nearly 100,000 sanitation inspections; meanwhile, other city departments have collected data on 311 campliants, business characteristics, and other information. With this information, the city's advanced analytics team and Department of Public Health teamed-up to forecast restaurants that are most likely to have critical violations so they are inspected first. The result is restaurants with critical violations are more likely to be discovered earlier by the Department of Public Health's inspectors.
